This repository contains the matlab code of the E. coli fed-batch model as published in: <br />
Cruz Bournazou et. al. 2016, B&B <br />
Online optimal experimental re‐design in robotic parallel fed‐batch cultivation facilities for validation of macro‐kinetic growth models  <br /> 
and in: <br />
Nickel et. al. 2016, Eng. Li. Sci. <br />
Online bioprocess data generation, analysis and optimization for parallel fed‐batch fermentations at mL scale <br />
<br />
The code is divided in two mflies, AAA_Starter_FedBatchSimulation.m ( to start the simulation of the fed-batch) and fn_e_coli.m containing the system of differential equations. <br />

Instructions:

- save both mfiles in your one folder of your computer
- open Matlab
- set the path to the folder you saved the files in
- open the mflie AAA_Starter_FedBatchSimulation.m
- press the play button (green triangle at the ribbon of the editor)
